# Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard

This interactive dashboard allows you to explore belly button biodiversity data.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. In the dashboard, you can do the following:

- **Select a Test Subject ID**: Use the dropdown menu to select a test subject ID, and the dashboard will display information and plots related to that subject.

- **Demographic Info**: The panel on the left displays demographic information for the selected test subject.

- **Top 10 OTUs Bar Chart**: The panel in the middle-left displays a bar chart showing the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for the selected test subject.

- **Bubble Chart**: The panel in the middle-right displays a bubble chart showing OTU data for the selected test subject.

- **Washing Frequency Gauge**: The panel on the right displays a gauge chart that shows the washing frequency for the selected test subject. The gauge chart has a pointer in the middle that indicates the washing frequency.

5. To update the data and charts when you select a different test subject ID from the dropdown menu, the code will automatically update the demographic information, bar chart, bubble chart, and the washing frequency gauge chart.
